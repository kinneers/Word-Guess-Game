        Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
        Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.

    <div>HARD MODE: Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
        Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
        Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
        Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.
        
        Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.
