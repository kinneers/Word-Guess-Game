## The Problem:
My middle school students loved playing Hangman on the whiteboard, but I was running out of dry erase markers!

## The Solution:
I created a simple Hangman-style web app game that could easily be projected to the Smartboard.

## Technical Approach:
I used Vanilla Javascript for DOM manipulation.  I chose a Christmas theme for this particular game and utilized HTML5 and CSS3 to create a stylish page.  (Special note for use in school settings: I make sure to check with parents in case there are any objections to holiday celebrations/content and encourage others to do the same.)

## Link to Live Site:
- [Play the Game!](https://kinneers.github.io/word-guess-game) - Head to the live site for some fun!

## To Use the Live Site:
This application requires a keyboard.
- Press any key to begin the game
- Guess a letter by pressing a letter key on the keyboard: If you guess correctly the letter will display on the screen and you will hear sleigh bells ringing.  If you guess incorrectly, you will hear a snowball splat and you remaining guesses will decrease by one.
- If you guess the word before running out of guesses you will get a win and a new round will automatically begin.
- If you run out of guesses you will get a loss and a new round will automatically begin.
